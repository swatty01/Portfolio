# Portfolio
Welcome to my data portfolio! This repository showcases my work in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning, completed using Python and Jupyter Notebook. Each project includes well-structured datasets, notebooks, reports, and visuals.
Projects Included

This portfolio contains two major projects:

1. Messy Food Waste Prediction — Data Cleaning, EDA & Machine Learning
Objective

To clean the raw food waste dataset, explore patterns using EDA, and build a machine learning model to predict messy food waste.

Jupyter Notebook

Key Insights

Missing values were cleaned and formatted.

Categorical features encoded.

Food waste patterns were explored through histograms, boxplots, and correlations.

A machine learning model was trained to predict messy food waste levels.

Model performance was evaluated and visualized.

2. Animal Dataset Analysis — Data Cleaning & EDA
Objective

To clean a dirty animal dataset and perform exploratory analysis to understand animal distribution, country patterns, numerical characteristics, and relationships.
